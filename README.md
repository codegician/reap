# Crypto investors are in the dark about their portfolios.




Reap is a passion project of mine. Crypto investors are faced with the prospect of having over 4+ wallets and having no way of knowing the total value of their portfolio without breaking out a calculator and logging into each account. REAP's value proposition is rooted in solving this by aggregating a user's wallet into one simple and aesthetically pleasing interface.


The flood of new investors to the crypto space is increasing exponentially. Being a relatively young market it is no surprise that more seasoned investors are having to cope with the hassle of managing their portfolios effectively. It’s so much of a hassle, that research shows that investors have simply accepted it. Opting instead to accumulate or sell as needed.

### “How many wallets do you have?” 



When prompted with this question the research participants unanimously looked exasperated. When asked, “How do calculate the total value of your portfolio?” They explained that they have to log in to each account to see what the value is at the moment and do some quick math. The answer remains subject to change as the crypto markets tend to be volatile.

### Investors want to know the total value of their portfolio. 



Reap offers this. The challenge was to ensure that it doesn’t balloon into solving all the problems that investors face in this space. Many competitors succumb to the idea that they can solve all these issues and end up missing the mark.



Reap is the only crypto portfolio app that provides complete aggregation for enthusiastic investors worldwide who want to track and know their portfolio’s value and contents in an era of having a wallet everywhere.

A notable design decision was including a screen to view the total value on each Exchange for users with multiple Exchange accounts and the total value of each coin regardless of where they are stored. This offers the most complete view of an investor's assets and performance.

The next step for this project is developing a prototype that can be tested by our users. My initial thought is to use Flutter to build the project. Having a working prototype that can be deployed to test flight is crucial to validate the project. A  solid team is desired and I am confident in the GitcoinDAO community's contributors to bring this product to life and into the hands of testers. 



## Current goal: Build a functional prototype that can be deployed to test flight.



# ReapDAO



I have a vision of building ReapDAO to govern the longevity of this product. The thought occurred to me that instead of relying upon a subscription-based model that only benefits select individuals we can build a business model where subscriptions lead to purchasing the ReapDAO utility token (name pending) and that token is then used to govern the platform in key ways. This idea is still being explored and there's much to learn and explore as the project sprouts wings.



Peace,

Ewart
